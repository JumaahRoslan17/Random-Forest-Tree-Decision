# Random-Forest-Tree-Decision
1. A cloth manufacturing company is interested to know about the segment or attributes contributing to high sale.
Approach - A decision tree can be built with target variable 'Sale' (we will first convert it into categorical variable) & all other variables will be independent in the analysis.
2. Use Decision Trees to prepare a model on fraud data, treating those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as "Risky" and others are "Good"
